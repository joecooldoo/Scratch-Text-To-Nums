##### Setup

```
import scratch_text_to_nums

ttn = scratch_text_to_nums
```

##### How To Use Encoding

To encode a string, simply use this code: `ttn.encode('example')`. Replace `example` with your own text.

**Note:** You can *ONLY* use lowercase letters and numbers.

##### How To Use Decoding

##### Scratchblocks
___

To decode encoded items in Scratch, export  [this project](https://turbowarp.org/585257923/editor), load it in Scratch, and backpack the custom block definitions. Then go to the project that you want the blocks to be in, open your backpack, and drag-n-drop the two custom block definitions to your project.
